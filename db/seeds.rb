Apology.create(body: "Hello everyone. I am writing you from my home where I have been social distancing since Mar 18th – when social distancing was instituted in the small community where I am currently living. At the time of my Mar 16th post, the directives from the authorities here were that we not congregate in groups of more than 250ppl and that we wash our hands regularly, which we were doing. Two days later, those directives changed and, despite my intense trepidation over the socioeconomic and political repercussions of this course of action, PLEASE KNOW I AM DOING MY PART TO FLATTEN THE CURVE, PRACTICING SOCIAL DISTANCING AND STAYING HOME WITH MY FAMILY. I want to offer my sincere and heartfelt apology for the insensitivity I showed in my previous post to the very real suffering and fear that has gripped the world through COVID19. Grandparents, parents, children, sisters and brothers are dying, the world is rallying to find a way to stop this very real threat, and my ensuing silence has sent a dismissive, arrogant and cryptic message. My direct and special apologies to those most affected by this pandemic. I never meant to hurt you. When I wrote that post 10 days ago, I thought I was infusing calm into the hysteria. I can see now that I was projecting my own fears into an already fearful and traumatic situation. I am grieved by the ongoing loss of life, and the impossible decisions medical workers around the world must make as they treat those affected. I am concerned for our communities – small businesses and families living paycheck-to-paycheck – and I am trying to follow responsible recommendations for how to help. Like many of you, I fear for the political aftermath of this pandemic, and I am praying for us all. At the same time, I am heartened by the beauty and humanity I see so many people demonstrating toward one another in this vulnerable time. When I was grappling with my own fears over social distancing, one kind, wise and gracious person said to me “do it out of love, not fear” and it helped me to realize my place in all of this.

While I don't remember ever making this specific statement and I have never judged others by their background or color of their skin, that's not really the point, what matters is that I clearly acted in ways which hurt other people. Whether it was my privileged position and perspective that caused me to be perceived as insensitive or inappropriate at times or whether it was just my immaturity and me just being unnecessarily difficult, I apologize for my behavior and for any pain which I have caused. We all can grow and change and I have difinitely used these past several months to reflect on my own shortcomings. I am a couple of months from becoming a mother and I know I need to keep working to better myself and take responsibility for my actions, so that I can be a real role model for my child and so I can pass along my lessons and mistakes, so that they can learn from me.

I am deeply sorry and I take full responsibility. It was a careless moment, one I'm ashamed and embarrassed by, but vow to continue to learn from. I regret using a word that carries so much pain and history to black people, as it is never a word to be used by someone who is not black. I have been learning so much about what it truly means to be an ally. The voices of black people must be amplified and heard clearly. As an Arabic woman, who can pass for white, I'm working hard to process this nuanced access I've been afforded, and I realize how important it is to be hyper vigilant in the spaces I exist in. I have been trying to understand the real definition of the word ally. It is more than simply believing in equality but to be willing to act with and for the black community. I aim to fight against these injustices and remind myself that this isn't about a title but an action to work against these systems that have protected me but not others. I am sorry that my ignorance has led to this moment. I will continue to support the black community as best as I can and learn from this. We as non black people must all take responsibilty for the inactivity we've been comfortable to sit with for so long- that has gotten us here.

Apology.create(body: "Over the past few days I've had some time for further reflection and listening and I think it's important to be more specific and elaborate on my apology for the extremely harmful and disgusting imagery in a sketch I made in 2016. The video was called 'Be Aware of Me' and in it, my character sings about all of the atrocities of the world and urges listeners to instead 'beaware of ME!' In one scene, I (a white woman) sing 'my relatives had slaves, I'm verified on twitter' while holding a rope placed around my friend Chris (a black man)'s neck as he poses as a slave. I take full responsibility for using this racist and inexcusable imagery as a flippant joke and know I have a lot of work to do to understand the full implications of my actions. There is a long and brutal history of white women performing violence on and exerting control over black men and I deeply regret showing an image that evokes that. When making the video, I thought it was funny because it was satirizing performative activism, and thought using racist imagery to make fun of racists was okay because I'm woke, I'm a liberal, I'm one of the good guys, it's so obviously ironic, right? Other people laughed and liberal-leaning media outlets picked up and praised the video – so it was all good, right? I'm cringing while typing this – how could I ever think that was okay? How could I think it was ok to use slavery as a punchline and not realize that this was making a joke at the expense of hundres of years of trauma? As a white woman, I've always benefitted fro mmy whiteness, I've been able to support liberal causes, to speak up about racial injustice on social media and then go about my day. And now I see my actions weren't as much a part of the solution as I intended, because of obviously glaring blind spots. I was a fucking idiot. I didn't see thn what is clear and hwat I better understand now – that not matter the intent, racist imagery is racist. It's pretty simple. As uncomfortable as this is, I'm grateful for this opportunity to look inward, ask myself those tough questions and come out more equipped to be of service on the other side, because that's what this is about. I want to make it clear – in no way am I the victim here. Black people in our country are marginalized, silenced, targeted, senselessly murdered for no reason other than being black and there are a lot of different forms of racist behavior. I'm ashamed I contributed to that. I also want to apologize to my dear friend Chris Murphy – who is a brilliant and very funny writer, comedian, actor, and thinker whom I love very much. I'm sorry for asking you to be in the sketch and for the pain it has caused you. Going forward, I'm going to read, listen, and educate myself fuerther. I have a long way to go and will never be finished. I'll continue donating money to causes that uplift black people and use my platform to amplify black voices. I'm not going to crawl away and disappear; I'm going to learn, gorw, and continue to speak out against racism. Thanks for reading this and holding me accountable.

I fear this will not convey everything I want it to, but I am speaking from the heart and trying my best to communicate my sincere regret. I am deeply embarrassed and more apologetic than you can ever know. My instinct is to share the varying degrees of explanation for every tweet that has offended, but I know full well there are no excuses. I will be sorry for as long as I live that I have hurt even one person, and I very much understand why my words have hurt many more. Also, I specifically would like to apologize to the Asian-American community, who I have hurt most with my tweets. I very much understand why you are hurt. An apology means nothing without action and change behind it, and I assure you that the reason these tweets are from years ago is because that action and change IS behind it. As my platform grew, I learned the power I had to amplify voices and the responsibility that came along with it. My platform and jobs are meaningful tools to foster diverse writers, combat workplace discriminiation, educate myself, donate, and to consciously and vocally support BIPOC, LGBTQ people and more. Every day I go into my jobs, my life, and my friendships trying to promote those ideals. I have been doing this work on myself and for others for years and can only promise that I will continue to do so, both publicly and privately.

I wish I could take them back, not to 'get out of trouble,' but because it is weighing heavily on my heart. But I can't. So instead, I have spent the last decade attempting to unlearn the complicit racism I participate in as a white person and becoming the vocally supportive ally I think I am now. I have been silent on this in the hopes that my current actions would speak louder than my past words, and that was my mistake, but I would like to make it very clear now how deeply sorry I am. I'm not posting the tweets here since I do not want to hurt people again with those words. But I want to be very clear: I am sorry. I mean it and I will prove that every day for the rest of my life.", user_id: 36, incident_id: 23)

Apology.create(body: "These last four weeks have been huge. The world is trying to make changea and I'm learning a tidal wave of information that frankly, was always there but I was unaware of. I've tried my best to post, learn, pass what I've learnt on to others and of course, echo the voices of those who don't have a platform to share their wisdom. Like many, I've read, listened, signed, donated, read again, ssh'd my white fragility and really wanted to trace instances in my life where I have been guilty. Whether big actions or small, we HAVE to look at ourselves and see how we were adding to this problem. One part I have identified in my own actions is cultural appropriation, which came to my attentionw when a fan last year pointed out a picture of me I had posted back when I was 17. I first heard the term cultural appropriation when I was 18. I ment my friend Holly (aged 17) who is a photographer for a photoshoot in London. We finished up by having a pint when I proudly pointed to my newly braided 'Corn Rows'. That summer, red carpets were full of famous, white women with either one side of their hair shaved or braided. I remember in every magazine there was a 'How To Do It Yourself!' version. I asked Holly if she liked them, she paused and said 'erm... in my school you're not allowed to get them anymore.' I gasped thinking that's so unfair, 'Why?!' She answered 'It's cultural appropriation. The school felt it necessary to ban them.' She began to explain to me what cultural apporpriation was, the history and heartbreak over how when Black girls do it they're mocked and judged, but when white girls do it, it's only then perceived as cool. It was true. I could see how Black culture was being so obviously exploited. I was defensive and confused, white fragility coming out plain and simple. I didn't want to upset anyone and was perplexed as to how I hadn't heard this term before. When I was 8 years old I befriended an Indian shop ower in Oxford whom I would visit regularly. This woman sold fabrics, incense, henna, bangles, pillow cases, jewellery, face bindis, body bindis... an 8 year olds' dream. She would gift me things, teach me how to use Kohl, show me where to place my bindi by pointing to her own, showing hwo she uses henna on her fingernails because thats what women from her culture did. She was excited to share her culture with me and I was excited to learn. There wasn't a summer where I didn't henna my hands, feet, my family's hands and feet, my friends- I was obsessed. Over the summer of 2017, Bindis and henna became a trend. Every top high street shop was selling their reimagined versions of this culture. I remember seeing large makeup brands selling an'Easy! Quick Dry!' henna ink pen and stencil in large commercial pharmackes. Even the art of creating those intricate designs were getting a shortcut. No one cared about the oirigin, a culture was being abused for profit. I felt embarrased. I felt sadness for the small family-run Indian shops all over the country. Seeing their culture and religion cheapened everywhere. I thought because I was taught about it differently, I was an exception. And here's the probem: I actually wasn't being respectful in how I was using it. I wore this culture on my terms only, to parties, at dinner. I too was disrespecting the beauty of the reigion that had been taught to me those years ago. The fan that called me out on Instagram was due to Rastafarian cultural appropriation. I was reminded of a photo when I was 17. I braided my hair and painted a beanie with the Jamaican flag colours and went to a friend's house; proud of my Rastafarian creation.I then posted about it the next day with a caption that paraphrased the lyrics to Shaggy's song 'Boombastic'. I am ashamed of so many things in those few sentences. 1) I had forgotten. How cruel. For 8 years I had no idea how many were offended. 2) At the time, I honestly did not think that I was doing anything wrong. Growing up as white and privileged allowed me to get that far and not know. 3) In the comments underneath I was even proud of it being my own hair. Stupid doesn't even cut it, I was uneducated. I was unread. I grew up watching my high profile pop culture idols adopting cultures in similar ways, so I didn't think wrong of doing it too. I now need to be aware that people are looking up to me and I must address my own poor actions. Black, Indian, Native American and Asian cultures and religions are constantly used and abused every new shopping season. It's not wrong to appreciate the beauty of a culture but rebranding them for the sake of a fashion trend and a $ most certainly is. I'm truly sorry to all of you that were offended for years or even just recently. I cannot dismiss the actions I bought into years ago, but I believe that we who were blind to such things must acknowledge them and recognize them as our faults, our ignorance and our white privilege and I apologise prfusely that it took this long.

In the piece I appear as a number of different characters interviewing myself, and some of the characters portrayed are people of color. I’d just about forgotten about this skit and I’m grateful that it has been brought to my attention. To watch myself in the various characters, including black and brown face, I acknowledge it was a major mistake in judgement that showed a lack of real understanding. It’s like looking in a mirror and seeing someone else- you’re not, or were not, the person you thought you were. We have huge blind spots about ourselves- well, I certainly do. I’d like to think I am beyond making mistakes like this, but clearly at the time I was not. Like I say at the end of our Broadway show American Utopia 'I need to change too'..and I believe I have changed since then. One hopes that folks have the grace and understanding to allow that someone like me, anyone really, can grow and change, and that the past can be examined with honesty and accountability.", user_id: 39, incident_id: 16)

It's left me with less joy, so I'm going to go try and work on that. I'm going to take a step back from the spotlight for a little while and go work on myself.

As someone who really believes in inclusivity and really, really detests cruelty, I owe you all an apology for the pain caused. I am sorry.

I should have known better. This is not the example I want to set for my son.

Apology.create(body: "I stand behind these women 1000%, believe them, know they are suffering and in pain, and feel strongly that their voices should be heard and taken seriously. What I am hearing abnout the allegations against R Kelly is absolutely horrifying and indefensible. As a victim of sexual assault myself, I made both the song and video at a dark time in my life, my intention was to create something extremely defiant and provocative because I was angry and still hadn't processed the trauma that had occurred in my own life. The song is called 'Do What U Want (With My Body)', I think it's clear how explicitly twisted my thinking was at the time. If I could go back and have a talk with my younger self I'd tell her to go through the therapy I have since then, so that I could understand the confused post-traumatic state that I was in– or if therapy was not available to me or anyone in my situation – to seek help, and speak as openly and honestly as possible about what we've been through. I can't go back, but I can go forward and continue to support women, men, and people of all sexual identities, and of all races, who are victims of sexual assault. I have demonstrated my stance on this issue and others many times throughout my career. I share this not to make excuses for myself, but to explain. Til it happens to you, you don't know how it feels. But I do know how I feel now. I intend to remove this song off of iTunes and other streaming platforms and will not be working with him again. I'm sorry, both for my poor judgment when I was young, and for not speaking out sooner. I love you.", user_id: 43, incident_id: 1)
